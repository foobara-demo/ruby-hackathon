1) copy/paste just crud commands from demo loan origination domain 
2) start building all other commands using AgentBackedCommand (with ollama if it works)
3) then I think McpConnector to show how claude code can operate the domain just like Foobara::Agent even though they are totally different

Then what?

a) Try to support creating these commands with DynamicCommand via a UI?
b) vibe-code a front-end?
  i) rails?
  ii) rack w/ React/Typescript frontend? (ask judge if this would hurt?)
c) attempt to use Autocrud to reduce number of implemented commands even further?


So far:

1) 10:40ish? Try breaking out a basic CRUD command out of DenyLoanFile command
